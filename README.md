# RGB Color Slider Web

Welcome to the RGB Color Slider Web application! This web application allows users to explore and select colors using the RGB color model.

## Features

1. RGB Sliders: The application provides three sliders, each representing one color channel of the RGB color model (red, green, and blue). Users can adjust the position of each slider to change the intensity of the corresponding color channel.

2. Color Preview: As users adjust the sliders, a color preview box dynamically updates to display the resulting color based on the current positions of the sliders.

3. Hex Code Display: The application also shows the corresponding hexadecimal color code for the selected color. Users can copy the hex code with a single click.

4. User Interaction: The sliders are interactive and respond to user inputs, such as dragging the slider handle or clicking on a specific position on the slider track. The color preview and hex code update in real time as the sliders are adjusted.
